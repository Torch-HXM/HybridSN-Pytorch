# Hybrid-Spectral-Net for Hyperspectral Image Classification.

## Description

The  HybridSN  is  spectral-spatial  3D-CNN  followed  by spatial 2D-CNN. The 3D-CNN facilitates the joint spatial-spectral feature  representation  from  a  stack  of  spectral  bands.  The  2D-CNN  on  top  of  the  3D-CNN  further  learns  more  abstract  level spatial  representation.
